/// Pass 3 **rendering driver** UITests for FeatureProofPhotoExample.
///
/// These tests are NOT benchmarks. They drive deterministic UI activity so
/// that a real-device xctrace recording (Time Profiler + Animation Hitches)
/// captures the ProofPhoto preview + comment rendering path BEFORE the
/// upload step. XCTest pass/fail is not the metric.
///
/// ## Intended use
///
/// 1. Launch on a real device with seed `proof-photo-prefilled`. The
///    `ProofPhotoApp` injects a deterministic 1024×1024 JPEG fixture via
///    the production `.galleryPhotoLoaded` action so `store.imageData`
///    is populated without invoking the OS Photos picker. The fixture
///    image is generated procedurally at runtime — no binary asset in
///    the repo.
/// 2. Attach `xcrun xctrace record --attach FeatureProofPhotoExample`
///    once `feature.proof-photo.ready` exists.
/// 3. Stop the trace when the test reports completion.
///
/// ## Scope
///
/// - Measures the local preview + comment rendering path only.
/// - Does NOT use the real Photos picker.
/// - Does NOT use the camera.
/// - Does NOT trigger server upload (`photoLogClient` is a local no-op
///   mock injected by `ProofPhotoApp`).
/// - Does NOT change the image pipeline (no downsampling, no compression
///   refactor) — those are Phase 2 follow-up if needed.
///
/// ## Scenarios
///
/// - `testRendering_proofPhotoPreviewWithFixtureImage` — preview render
///   stable + 6s idle window (captures any TimelineView-driven cursor
///   work inside the comment overlay and any image-render side effects).
/// - `testRendering_proofPhotoCommentTyping` — tap comment circle to
///   focus + type 5 ASCII characters one by one. Each character mutates
///   `store.commentText`, re-renders the comment circle, and the cursor
///   `TimelineView` runs while focused.
